					<h3><b>I want to talk to someone that is not required to report the incident. (e.g. confidential resources). </b></h3>
					<h5> I do not want to report or am not ready to report.</h5>
					<ul><b>Confidential Resources:</b>
						<li><a href="https://www.publicsafety.upenn.edu/about/special-services/">Special Services Unit in the Division of Public Safety</a></li>
						<li><a href="http://www.vpul.upenn.edu/caps/#emergency">Penn Women's Center</a> (not just for female-identifying individuals!)</li>
						<li><a href="http://www.vpul.upenn.edu/caps/">Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS)</a> (and ask for the The Sexual Trauma Treatment Outreach and Prevention (STTOP) Team (required to set an appointment with you within 1 week)</li>
						<li> <a href="http://www.vpul.upenn.edu/shs/index.php">Student Health Service (SHS)</a> (if you are a female, Women's Health will examine you, discuss sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment, provide you with emergency contraception if necessary, and discuss follow-up with you *SHS does not provide rape kits for legal evidence)</li>
						<li> Additional resources include The Office of the Chaplain, Office of the Ombudsman, Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender (LGBT) Center </li>
					</ul>
					<p>****You may be more comfortable speaking with RAs/GAs and other College House Faculty and Staff. However, they are required to report sexual violence incidents.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="w3-half">
					<h3><b>I want to talk to someone and definitely want to report the incident. </b></h3>
					<h5>I understand that some resources are required to report an incident.</h5>
					<p>You can go to any of Penn Violence Prevention’s campus resources, including the listed confidential resources, for help to report an incident.</p>

			<h3><i> <b> I am overwhelmed by this list of resources and really am not sure who to go to!</i></b> </h3>
			<p> <b>While there may be an overwhelming amount of resources on campus, all of the resources on campus are well connected and starting at any of them will help you get to where you need to be. You can go to the resource you are most comfortable with.
			</p>
			<p> A great starting point is contacting Sanjana Bijlani, Associate Director of the Penn Women’s Center sbijlani@upenn.edu (Penn Women’s Center:  215.898.6500, 215.898.8611) or contacting Special Services (Penn Police at 215.573.3333). </p>
			<p>If you do not feel comfortable meeting at the Penn’s Women Center or Penn Police, you can request to meet at a better location for you (i.e. Starbucks)</p>
